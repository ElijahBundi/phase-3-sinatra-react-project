## Introduction
Welcome to construction blog App, where dreams come home! We encourage you to search, read, explore, review and let us guide you home. Our layout is extremely user friendly, offering a beautiful interface as the blogs we offer. Our mantra being the magnitude of the minute, we showcase simplicity in its most grandiose form. 


## Setup

After unbundling the project:

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
2. Run `npm run server`. This will run your backend on port `8004`.
3. In a new terminal, run `npm start`. This will run your React app on port `8000`.

Make sure to open [http://localhost:9292/blogs](http://localhost:9292/blogs) in the browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!

The base URL for your backend is: `http://localhost:9292`

2. I can add a new blog to the list of blogs while sending that data back to the server.
